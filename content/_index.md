## Hobbies/Interests

I'm the creator, producer and host of a podcast about death and dying called [Departed](https://departed.fm), launching later this year. I consume a seemingly impossible amount of information through reading and listening books (I'm currently reading [Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up by Jerry Colonna](https://amzn.to/2LIbSan)), listening to podcasts and reading through my RSS feeds. I'm a reluctant Family and Friends CTO. I enjoy rock climbing, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), skateboarding and snowboarding and all the gear that goes along with the activities. I listen to music constantly - everything from classical to ambient electronic to avant-garde jazz to indie rock.
