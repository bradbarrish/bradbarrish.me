## Hobbies/Interests
I’m the creator, producer and host of a podcast about death and dying called [Departed](https://departed.fm), launching later this year. I consume a seemingly impossible amount of information through reading and listening books (I’m currently reading [Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up by Jerry Colonna](https://amzn.to/2LIbSan)), listening to podcasts and reading through my RSS feeds. I’m a reluctant CTO for family and friends. I enjoy rock climbing, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), skateboarding and snowboarding. I listen to music constantly - everything from classical to ambient electronic to avant-garde jazz to indie rock.
