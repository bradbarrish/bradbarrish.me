## Professional Experience

**Sonos, Inc. -- Director, Customer Experience** <br/>
_March 2014 - June 2020_

As the Customer Experience leader for Sonos, I was responsible for deeply understanding customer pain points and through direct feedback and large data, including product telemetry and product diagnostics. I presented qualitative and quantitative insights to the executive team and other leaders across the company. I lead the Voice of the Customer effort for Sonos, working across Product and Go-To-Market teams to help create multi-modal, customer-facing products, tools and experiences. I charted the course for how Sonos cared for customers in the future and consulted closely on what technologies we leveraged to provide a world class support experience.

Outside of my day-to-day responsibilities, I also worked closely with our People team on programs that improved the culture of Sonos such as Employee Experience (EX), developing our annual employee survey and management programs.

## Hobbies/Interests

I'm the creator, producer and host of a podcast about death and dying called [Departed](https://departed.fm), currently in production. I consume a seemingly impossible amount of information through reading and listening to books (I'm currently reading [How Children Learn by John Holt](https://bookshop.org/a/9430/9780738220086)), listening to podcasts and reading through my RSS feeds. I'm a reluctant Family and Friends CTO.

I enjoy rock climbing, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), skateboarding and snowboarding and all the gear that goes along with the activities. I listen to music constantly - everything from classical to ambient electronic to avant-garde jazz to indie rock. One of my current favorites is [RTJ4 by Run The Jewels](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cx4GVNs03Pu4ZczRnWiLd?si=4baoUSN8Q86kkSQWl_qeLg)
